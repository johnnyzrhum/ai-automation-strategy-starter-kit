## 🧭 Step 1: Scan for Patterns

Answer the following:

- What manual tasks do you repeat weekly?
- Where do you spend time copying/pasting info between tools?
- What processes rely heavily on email or spreadsheets?
- Where do handoffs between people frequently cause delays?
- What steps could be done faster or better with AI summarization, classification, or generation?

## 📊 Step 2: Opportunity Table

Use the table below to capture potential automation opportunities:

| # | Task / Process                          | Pain Point / Friction                  | Frequency     | Impact if Improved | AI/Automation Potential |
|---|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | Ex: Client onboarding                   | Repetitive CRM entry, manual emails    | 5x/week       | High                | High                     |
| 2 |                                           |                                        |               |                     |                          |
| 3 |                                           |                                        |               |                     |                          |
| 4 |                                           |                                        |               |                     |                          |

## 🔍 Step 3: Evaluate & Prioritize

Sort your ideas using a quick scoring system:

| Score | Effort   | Impact    | Next Step         |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| High  | Low      | High      | ✅ Pilot Now       |
| Med   | Medium   | High      | 🔜 Plan to Test    |
| Low   | High      | Low       | ❌ Avoid for Now   |
