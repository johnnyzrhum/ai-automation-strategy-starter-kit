## 🧩 Use Case: Client Onboarding for Creative Services

**Manual Workflow**
1. Sales rep emails new client form to ops team  
2. Ops manually enters client info into CRM  
3. Project manager reviews form and creates kickoff doc  
4. Email chain starts to schedule kickoff meeting  
5. Creative briefs are written and saved to Drive  

This workflow is slow, manual, and error-prone.

## ⚡ AI-Augmented Workflow

1. Client fills out smart intake form (e.g., Tally)  
2. AI parses and classifies info → auto-enters into CRM via Zapier  
3. AI drafts project brief and kickoff doc in Google Docs  
4. Calendar invites auto-send to client + team  
5. Slack alert posts to creative channel
