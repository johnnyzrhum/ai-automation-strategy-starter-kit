# Workflow Simplifier: AI-Generated SEO Content for Advertiser Web Pages

This sample shows how a Lean Ops strategist and AI architect could transform the manual SEO copywriting process into an AI-augmented workflow using the [`workflow-simplifier.txt`](../prompts/workflow-simplifier.txt) prompt.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Speed up the production of SEO-ready advertiser web pages by using AI to generate core content, metadata, and visual assets—while allowing human review before publishing.

---

## 🧩 Current Manual Workflow (Before AI)

1. Copywriter researches the advertiser’s business from intake forms or online  
2. Writes a unique business description for SEO  
3. Creates or requests a properly named hero image and uploads to CMS  
4. Writes metadata (alt tags, file names, etc.) for images and logos  
5. Crafts a marketing message with embedded keywords  
6. Writes bulleted lists of menu items or services  
7. Gathers location info, contact info, and social media links  
8. Formats and publishes in CMS manually

## ⚡ AI-Augmented Workflow (After Simplification)

1. Advertiser completes structured intake form (industry, services, contact, brand tone, keywords, etc.)  
2. AI model parses intake → generates:  
   - SEO business description  
   - Keyword-rich marketing message  
   - Bulleted service/menu list  
   - Location + general info section  
   - Suggested social copy / snippets  
3. AI renames and tags uploaded assets (logo, hero image) for SEO  
4. AI suggests hero image (or generates via DALL·E) and auto-inserts alt tags and filenames  
5. Human editor reviews and approves in CMS before publish

## 🧠 Suggested Tools

- **ChatGPT**: content generation, tone control, keyword integration  
- **Zapier / Make**: automate from form submission → content → CMS draft  
- **DALL·E or Midjourney**: generate hero images if none provided  
- **ImageMagick / Squoosh**: optimize and rename assets  
- **Airtable / Notion**: review layer before publish  
- **Headless CMS or WordPress**: content storage and publishing

## 📉 Before vs After Comparison

| Metric                     | Manual Workflow | AI-Aided Workflow |
|----------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Time to publish 1 page     | ~1–2 hours       | ~15–20 minutes    |
| Copy consistency           | Variable         | Standardized      |
| SEO metadata completeness  | Often missed     | Auto-filled       |
| Human review requirement   | 100% hands-on    | Light-touch QA    |
