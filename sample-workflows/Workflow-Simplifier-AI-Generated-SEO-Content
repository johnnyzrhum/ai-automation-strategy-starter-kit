# Workflow Simplifier (AI-Assisted): SEO Content Generation for Advertiser Pages

This use case demonstrates how to simplify the manual process of building SEO-ready advertiser web pages using AI and automation—reducing content production time while increasing consistency and discoverability.

## 🎯 Goal

Redesign a slow, multi-step content workflow using AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude alongside low-code automation platforms.

## 🧩 Use Case: Advertiser Web Page Creation

**Manual Workflow**
1. Copywriter reviews advertiser intake form or does online research  
2. Writes business description for SEO  
3. Crafts a keyword-rich marketing headline  
4. Uploads and renames logo and hero image, writes alt tags  
5. Creates bulleted service or menu list  
6. Gathers and formats contact info, location, and social links  
7. Manually enters everything into CMS for publishing  

This workflow is time-consuming and inconsistent across advertisers.

## ⚡ AI-Augmented Workflow

2. AI generates:
   - SEO business description  
   - Keyword-optimized marketing message  
   - Bulleted list of services or menu items  
   - Location, contact, and social sections  
3. AI renames and tags uploaded assets  
4. AI suggests or generates hero image (optional)  
5. Automation tool inserts content into CMS draft for review  
6. Human editor finalizes and publishes
