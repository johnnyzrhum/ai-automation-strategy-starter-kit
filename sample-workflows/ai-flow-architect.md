# AI Flow Architect: Designing AI-Augmented Workflows

This use case shows how to redesign a process by embedding AI actions within key steps—focusing on automation, accuracy, and user experience.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Transform a manual workflow into an AI-enhanced system by identifying:
- Where AI can reduce human effort
- How automation improves outcomes
- How to maintain user trust and human oversight

---

## 🧩 Use Case Example

**Manual Process: Email Triage for Customer Support**

1. Support inbox receives new tickets
2. Support manager reads each and assigns manually
3. Agents read again and tag/route internally
4. Customer notified by agent

---

## 🤖 AI-Enhanced Flow

1. Inbox → routed through AI (via Zapier or webhook)
2. AI reads and classifies ticket by intent/urgency
3. AI adds tags, routes to proper queue, and drafts a reply
4. Human agent reviews and hits “send” if accurate
