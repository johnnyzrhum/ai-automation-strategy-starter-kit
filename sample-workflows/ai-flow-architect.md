# AI Flow Architect: Designing AI-Augmented Workflows

This use case shows how to redesign a manual process by embedding AI at strategic steps—focusing on automation, accuracy, and human-in-the-loop oversight.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Create scalable, intelligent workflows by:
- Reducing repetitive human effort
- Accelerating processing and routing
- Maintaining quality through human review checkpoints

## 🧩 Use Case: Email Triage for Customer Support

**Current Manual Process:**
1. Support inbox receives new tickets
2. Support manager manually reviews and assigns
3. Agents re-read, tag, and route messages
4. Agents manually write responses
5. Final response sent to customer

This process is repetitive, slow, and vulnerable to delays or inconsistent tagging.

---

## 🤖 AI-Augmented Workflow

1. New email triggers webhook or Zapier automation
2. AI model (e.g., GPT, Claude) classifies intent and urgency
3. Tags are applied based on classification
4. Ticket is routed to the appropriate queue
5. AI drafts a contextual response
6. Human agent reviews and approves/send
