## 🧩 Use Case: Coupon Ad Copy Creation

**Manual Workflow**
1. Copywriter researches coupon performance by category (e.g., pizza, nail salon)  
2. Reviews competitor ads and historical performance  
3. Writes offer-based copy (headline, call-to-action, disclaimers)  
4. Designs suggested layout or coordinates with designer for placement  
5. Formats copy for print layout and digital placements (e.g., banner, mobile)  
6. Submits for internal review and approval  

This process is slow and resource-intensive, especially when scaled across many advertisers.

## ⚡ AI-Augmented Workflow

1. Internal user selects coupon category and brand tone from dropdown (or intake form)  
2. AI references historical promo types (via structured examples or prompt chaining)  
3. AI generates:
   - Headline and offer copy tailored to category
   - Secondary call-to-action or upsell line
   - Optional disclaimers
   - Copy formatted for both print and digital
4. AI suggests layout inspiration (e.g., text/image ratio, CTA placement)  
5. Human editor selects preferred version for routing to designer or CMS
