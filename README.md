# AI & Automation Strategy Starter Kit

This starter kit provides a practical, tactical framework for identifying, designing, and testing AI-powered automation solutionsâ€”without jumping straight into code.

Itâ€™s built for tech leaders, product managers, and innovation teams who want to simplify workflows, reduce manual effort, and drive digital transformation using real-world examples and proven tools.

## ðŸš€ Key Principles

- **Start Small, Scale Fast**  
  Prototype ideas quickly using AI assistants or low-code tools before full implementation.

- **Keep People at the Center**  
  Focus on improving the user experience, not just replacing it with automation.

- **Simplicity Over Complexity**  
  Prioritize eliminating steps over layering on tech.

## ðŸ”§ What's Inside

| Component                              | Purpose                                                    |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `prompts/`                             | Pre-written ChatGPT prompts to help design or analyze workflows |
| `sample-workflows/`                    | Real-world workflow examples, with Mermaid diagrams & results |
| `opportunity-worksheet.md`             | Simple worksheet to map where automation could help        |
| `decision-framework.md`                | Lightweight decision tree to prioritize what to automate   |
| *(coming soon)* `assets/diagrams/`     | Visual PNGs of workflow diagrams for slides and reports    |

## ðŸ§  How to Use This Kit

1. **Explore the examples in `sample-workflows/`**  
   Each file shows a real automation scenario: what changed, how AI fits in, and expected outcomes.

2. **Use the matching prompt in `prompts/`**  
   Drop your own process into the prompt (e.g. current workflow steps) to generate AI-augmented flows or ROI analyses.

3. **Test your idea in a low-code tool**  
   Try Make, Zapier, Airtable, or a simple Google Workspace script to prototype your workflow.

4. **Evaluate with the decision framework**  
   Is it worth building out further? Use the decision matrix to score for effort and impact.
